Project Title: Library Management System (Java + MySQL).

Type: Full-Stack Java Application

🚀 I’m excited to share one of my recent Java-based projects – a Library Management System designed for educational institutions and small libraries. Built with core Java technologies and powered by a MySQL database, this system demonstrates strong backend logic, user authentication, and real-time record management.
🕳️ tool used :| Netbeans

 Key Features:
📚 Add & Manage Students: Register new students and manage their records efficiently.
📖 Book Management: Add, view, and delete books from the library’s catalog.
👨‍💼 Admin Panel: Admins can manage access, book data, and system-wide controls.
📥 Book Issuing & Returning: Fully functional system to issue and return books with due date tracking.
📊 Statistics Dashboard: Track issued books, available inventory, and user activity for better decision-making.
🔐 Secure Login System: Role-based authentication system to ensure secure access to the system.
